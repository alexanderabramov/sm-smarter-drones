# Smarter Drones
Smarter Drones is a mod for a game Surviving Mars by Haemimont Games.

It intends to improves Drone AI in small but crucial ways.

First improvement:
- when dumping Waste Rock, drones carry it to the closest available Dumping Site or pile (unlike round-robin in the base game). This is an enormous efficiency boost if you have more than one source of waste rock in range of one drone controller.

Compatibility:
- does not modify any game objects, so should be compatible with almost any mods, and can be added/removed to existing saves
- modifies some functions in Drone and DroneControl classes, could break after game updates
